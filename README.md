# Lightweigtht-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-MRI-Scans
I Have Created a Custom Made CNN Model ready for deployment and trained on MRI Scnas for heart Disease Prediction. It contains a accuracy of above 90 percent
This Project use Python and is integrated with a local host website created using django. The whole project can be run using Python

This Project contains custom my Custom CNN Model and its past iterations along with other known ML Models for Comparison

The Dataset used can be found on Kaggle As Cardiac MRI Dataset
